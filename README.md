This repo is for my livestreaming channel page

# Basic functionality
It will show whenever I am online at twitch by switching the 'Status' color and updating the button to watch stream or wether update it.
Unfortunately it won't update by itself as Github is static.

# Info
This was only to learn how deploying works, this will contain future features like connections to MySql a CRUD using API written in Node.js. This also utilizes NuxtJS framework.
